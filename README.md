NSS Â· namespace.style
---
The missing link between your HTML and CSS.

Make your element class names type-safe.
Make your UI code testable by default.
Make debugging DOM a dream â€“ everything, effortlessly, has a name.
Make magic-string composition utils a thing of your past.
Make miles-long class-atom strings begone from your templates.
Make the intersection of HTML and CSS something that's finally understood by your static-analysis tools.
Make unused, unhelpful CSS classes impossible.

> Namespaces are one honking great idea â€“ let's do more of those!

*â€“ Tim Peters*
